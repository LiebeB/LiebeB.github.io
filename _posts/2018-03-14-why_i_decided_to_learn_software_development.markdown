A few years ago, I delved into the coding realm. I was volunteering at a book festival in Cape Town and I got involved with the Wikimedia ZA organisation. I started to look into coding and programming... I found that I was interested in UXD and Business Analysis. 

I decided at that point to stay in education. I had been teaching accounting and business studies in South Africa. My next job would land me in China, where I taught economics in Xi'an (where the Terracotta army is) and then in Nanjing (which is close to Shanghai). 

As much as I enjoy Nanjing and working with children, I felt as though I needed to do something else. I want to work in an environment where creative problem-solving and critical thinking skills are welcomed. I am sure there are schools where those features are incorporated to establish a conducive learning environment. I have worked at five schools, and I am yet to find such an organisation. My hope for the future is that more schools will be created to develop students holistically. Life is more than exam scores. 

I knew that if I choose to change the course of my career and follow this path, I would be able to enjoy more job satisfaction where my analytical side will continually be challenged. I know that I will still volunteer at the animal shelter, the environmental organisation, and work with children in my free time. This would be in addition to the work fulfilment I will be able to achieve.

I have learned long ago that I need to ensure that I make decisions that make me happy (in a self-sustaining way). Sometimes, that means leaving precious things behind. My hope is to always keep that memory, connected in an intricate way. My aim is always to learn from my lessons. Our experiences are woven into our hearts and they become a part of who we are, shaping our minds, hearts and being. I love learning to fly, while maintaining my roots and staying true to who I am.

We live in an age where anything is possible. And I am excited to be a part of that movement.
