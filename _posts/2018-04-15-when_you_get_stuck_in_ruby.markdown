This whole process of learning, developing and growing has been exhilirating. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating, but the intrinsic reward (when you solve an issue) is amazing! When I get stuck, I remind myself that I chose this path. I decided to take on a new challenge and to push my limits. It is a rewarding experience.

While working in Ruby, I've had a few errors (as is apparently normal in the tech world). I've found that sometimes I complicate things for myself too much. I can start off with the code much more complex than it needs to be. My advice: follow the instructions, step-by-step. Don't overthink it. Just do it.

Another issue: case-sensitivity. Coding in Ruby is quite delicate. Once, I got this error:

Failure/Error: sayhello() #<IO:<STDOUT>> received :puts with unexpected arguments

expected: ("Hello Ruby Programmer!")  
   got: ("Hello Ruby programmer!")
	 

Notice how the expected and got arguments are exactly the same? Except for one tiny difference: The program expected "Programmer" with a capital P (I typed it in lowercase). Luckily, the other students and a coach was able to chat to me about it. They simply ask a question or make a comment. And then that rewires your own brain and thinking pattern, which ultimately assists in this conducive learning process.

There are various avenues to follow when you find yourself stuck in Ruby. You can conduct a Google search and find some helpful hints on GitHub or similar platforms. You can also Ask A Question in the lab you are currently working on. Furthermore, you can join a study group and have a live chat with some of your classmates and a facilitator.

The aim is to conduct research and to create your own understanding of this process. Ruby might change in the future, but it is important to invent your own creative solutions and to develop critical thinking skills.
